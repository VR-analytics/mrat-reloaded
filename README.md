# MRAT: The Mixed Reality Analytics Toolkit

This repository contains code and examples described in detail in our (conditionally accepted) CHI 2020 paper _MRAT: The Mixed Reality Toolkit_ (to appear in April 2020).

We are currently still in the process of working with U-M Tech Transfer to determine appropriate licensing options and moving the latest code from our private repositories into this public repository. We expect this process to be completed just before CHI in April 25-30, 2020.
